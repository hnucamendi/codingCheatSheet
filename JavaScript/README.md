| Just in Time Compilation     | refers to the way code is executed, Just in time compilation means that while executing it is also being compiled. In other words, you start running the code -> a block of code is compiled -> run that code -> then compile more code and continue the cycle until the whole program is executed. JavaScript works this way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| First Class Functions        | First class functions are a feature that some programming languages have, including JavaScript. It allows functions to be assigned to variables like any other primitive type. Example: `const exampleFunction = function(){}`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Higher Order Functions       | A feature of some programming languages, including JavaScript. It allows us to insert a function into the argument of another function. Example: Defining the functions `function example1(data){} function example2(){}` calling the functions `example1(example2)` In this example we define two functions; one that takes in a parameter `data`. and another that takes no arguments. then we can pass in the second function as that parameter `data` and in a real example, the function call would return something, by calling back to the second function |
| Prototype Based Programming  | A concept of OOP, the idea is that we can reuse objects as `prototypes`. So while we are not changing the original function, we are changing and reusing a prototype of the existing function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Programming Paradigm         | A way to classify an approach or style of programming. Often languages are built around specific paradigms, but languages can also support multiple paradigms; called multi-paradigm languages. you can learn more about the different paradigms here: [Programming Paradigms](https://www.indicative.com/resource/programming-paradigm/)                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Multi-Paradigm               | A programming language that supports multiple coding paradigms, popular ones are Object Oriented Programming(OOP), Functional Programming, and Procedural Programming. JavaScript is a language that is very flexible and supports OOP and functional programming                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Single Threaded              | In programming the code we write has to be run on some part of the physical computer, code most of the time runs on a thread on the computer's CPU. JavaScript is famous for being single-threaded, meaning only one piece of code will run at a time and block any two processes from running concurrently. This has its Pros and Cons, and like most things in JavaScript, there are ways around the single-threaded nature of JavaScript; something called promises or asynchronous execution                                                                  |
| Dynamic Programming Language | a dynamic programming language refers to the way variables are handled and defined. Example: `const testVariable = 12` is dynamic because we declare the variable name and the value, and the computer takes care of understanding what kind of variable it is. JavaScript is a dynamic programming language.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Static Programming Language  | a static programming language refers to the way variables are handled and defined. Example: `const testVariable int = 12` Here we have to define the variable name `testVariable`, the variable type `int`, and the variables value `12`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Object Oriented Paradigm     | In this paradigm code should be written in objects with code that mimics how we think of objects in real life. For example: we think of a car as an object with 4 wheels, a color, a model, and more things to define what a car is, and what kind it is. In code, we would have an object just like this to declare the color, model, and other attributes of a car object. OOP also introduces abstraction, learn more about abstraction in the next entry                                                                                                      |
| Abstraction                  | Abstraction is a common practice in programming where instead of typing the value for something by hand for each possible configuration, we create a variable that changes its value based on the configuration. Example: `const config1 = 1 const config2 = 2 const config3 = 3` vs an example with abstraction `const abstractedVariables = (config) => config ` you can see with abstraction we can accomplish the same functionality with less code.                                                                                                          |
| imperative Programming       | focuses on describing how a program operates step by step, rather than on high-level descriptions of its expected results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| declarative Programming      | Declarative programming introduces abstraction similar to OOP, but instead of declaring the objects that the user will use in blocks in declarative programming, we define the desired outcome or the task to execute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Procedural Programming       | A type of Imperative programming where code is written and read from the top down in the order that it is written. Languages like `Basic` or `C` are procedural                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Primitive Types              | The most basic data types available in a language, serve as the foundation for manipulating data in code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Method                       | Same concept as a function, we can use the term method and function interchangeably. Usually, methods are for functionality that is attached to an object                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Object                       | a data type that is defined as a key pair, we can define primitive values or data types within an object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Boiler Plate Code            | Code that we need to define for certain functionality in a programming language to function correctly. In JavaScript, we don't usually need boilerplate code, but within some frameworks, we do use some boilerplate code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Hoisted                      | Meaning to be tied up to something. In Coding this translates to a function that is tied to the top of the screen, so no matter what comes before it a `Hoisted function` will always be read first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Function                     | A way of grouping code so that we can later invoke or call this group of code and not have to re-write any code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Anonymous Function           | An anonymous function is a function without a variable name or identifier, They are fundamental for more advanced code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Return Keyword               | Used to return a value but not print it, it will be assigned to the variable that the function is held in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Arguments                    | Arguments are passed in a function call (when invoking a function) to be used in the code the function executes. These variables are local to the specific function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Parameters                   | Parameters are used in a function definition to initialize local variables that are expected to be passed in later when calling(invoking) the function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
